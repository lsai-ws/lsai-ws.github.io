The **1st Doctoral Workshop on Law, Society and Artificial Intelligence** invites PhD candidates to explore the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Law and Society. 

The workshop explores the growing impact of Artificial Intelligence on society from a **legal**, **technical** and **ethical** standpoint, underlying the existing relationship between the technical and social aspects of AI research and deployment, as it aims to foster a multidisciplinary discussion on the implications of AI for society and the law.

Legal scholars grapple with the ethical and juridical implications of increasingly autonomous AI systems, particularly concerning decision-making processes and potential biases within algorithms, within a rapidly evolving field of research. Legal frameworks are being reevaluated to address issues of liability and accountability in a world where AI plays an ever-more prominent role, facing issues in human-computer interaction, accountability, explainability and ethics.
 
We invite and welcome submissions of original, unpublished **abstracts** that explore the domain of Law, AI and Society. A series of **suggested research themes** are present to foster a varied and multifaceted discussion.


## Topics 
Relevant abstracts cover one or more of the following topics:
- Ethical, legal, and social issues in human-computer interaction.
- Automation and accountability in AI-based decision-making.
- Civil and criminal liability for AI-based systems.
- Explainable, interpretable, and transparent AI.
- Impact of general-purpose AI models.
- Legal and ethical frameworks for AI governance. 
- The development and deployment of AI in the legal domain.
- AI for Democracy and Legislative Action.
- AI, User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) design.
